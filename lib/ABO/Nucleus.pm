# Generic ABO object constructor.

# Most classes in the ABO universe are sub-classes of the ABO::Base
# class, and their objects are created using this "make" method, which:
#
# (a) loads the package if not already loaded; this permits lazy loading
# analogous to the standard Perl SelfLoader, to avoid compilation of
# unwanted packages;
#
# (b) creates and blesses a new anonymous hash (all ABO::Base objects
# are anonymous hashes);
#
# (c) propagates a reference to the Nucleus object; and
#
# (d) calls the optional constructor "init" on the new object.
#
# Objects which are not sub-classes of ABO::Base are normally created by
# calling the "new" method, following the Perl convention.  This "make"
# method does not know how to do that, so it cannot be used to create
# such objects.  However, objects which are not sub-classes of ABO::Base
# but (a) use a blessed anonymous hash, and (b) have a constructor
# called "init", can be created with this "make" method.

# Configuration.

# The ABO system is configured through a variety of configuration files.
# The ABO::Config package knows how to locate and parse these files, and
# provides access to the resulting values through a few, simple methods.
#
# A single ABO::Config object is created and initialised on ABO startup,
# and the first nucleus object is given a reference to it through this
# "set_config" method.  Thereafter, all forks of the nucleus will share
# a reference to that object, thereby making the configuration available
# to all ABO objects through their nucleus.
#
# Some ABO objects have their own, private configuration files (for
# example, each ABO::Book object), whose settings are confined to that
# object and all objects created by it.  In this case, the object forks
# the nucleus, then forks the ABO::Config object using the "fork_config"
# method here, then instructs the forked copy to incorporate additional
# configuration files.

##############################################
# Error reporter.

# Perl's support for exceptions is a bit patchy (the thrown exception is
# always a string, and there is no "try...catch" syntax like Java's), so
# the ABO package uses a different approach to dealing with failures.
#
# In general, if a failure is caused by an internal programming error
# (such as passing illegal arguments between ABO objects, or a failed
# assertion) then ABO bails out using 'die', 'Carp::croak', or
# 'Carp::confess'.
#
# In all other cases (such as invalid user input, corruption of data
# recovered from disk, or invalid arguments passed in from outside ABO),
# a verbose, informative, diagnostic message (in English) is output at
# the point where the error is detected, and the method returns a result
# indicating failure, allowing methods to exit voluntarily up to a level
# where the failure can be accommodated.
#
# The output of the diagnostic message is performed using the ABO::Error
# error-reporting object that is initialised at ABO startup.  This
# allows the code that invokes ABO to handle the messages as it sees fit
# (in a typical command-line utility they are output to STDERR, prefixed
# with the name of the program, but in a GUI invironment for example,
# they might result in a pop-up dialog, or displayed in a scrolling
# "progress" window).
#
# A lot of cleverness goes on in ABO::Error to compensate for the
# inability in Perl to catch an exception and re-throw it with some
# extra information aggregated, or in another form.

# Transaction validator.

# This is a piece of information that the nucleus carries to the
# constructor of ABO::Transaction, which uses it to perform a final
# validity check of each transaction object created, before returning.
# This allows any ABO object to place any restriction on the
# transactions that it can produce, effectively acting as a guarantee
# that its transactions conform.
#
# This could also have been done by performing the same check on all
# transactions in the object itself, before returning them, but by then
# the context of origin of the transaction is lost, so the diagnostic
# message would be useless to the user, who wants to know exactly what
# piece of input provoked the problem.
